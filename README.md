## Why I Created this Project

-   I wanted a fast way to use ChatGPT in the terminal

## Technologies Used

-   üêç Python to help interface with OpenAI's api

## How to Run the Project

Clone the repository and then run the following commands in the directory:

```bash
pip install  openai
python3 main.py
```

Make sure you make your api key available in your local environment. Here's an easy way to do it:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY="xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" python3 main.py
```

If you want a more permanent solution you can add this line to your `.bashrc`

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
```
